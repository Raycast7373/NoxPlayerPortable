# NoxPlayerPortable
A script that will make a almost portable version of NoxPlayer (Windows Only) (using 7zip and HttpDownloader)

How to run setup:
run one of the bat files (Setup-No-Pause-Clean-After.bat is the best to run). 
after the script complete running the folder noxplayer is ready to beign copied, you can copy that folder to whereever you want (like a usb). 

How to launch:
to launch noxplayer, run the bat file in the noxplayer folder (normal you would use RunNox.bat). i need to find a way to redirect Program files since it cant run without Bignox and thats a problem since i cant get it to work in the same folder...



Sorry for my bad english


Note:
The chance that i would update this is not very big.
